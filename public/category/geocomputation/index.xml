&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link href=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/anchor-sections/anchor-sections.css&#34; rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; /&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/anchor-sections/anchor-sections.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Successful control of COVID-19 pandemic not only depends on the research and development of effective vaccines, but also on delivery of these vaccines to everyone. Therefore, for any country the total cost–procurement plus delivery cost– to vaccinate its population is a crucial information as this can help the country to plan, raise, and allocate resources needed to successfully vaccinate their population against the COVID-19 pandemic. This information becomes even more important and pressing for low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) which are already under enormous financial stress due to the impact of COVID-19 on their economies. Therefore, I, along with my colleagues at &lt;a href=&#34;https://centerforpolicyimpact.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The center for policy impact in global health&lt;/a&gt; developed an application where one can obtain, and predict the total cost COVID-19 vaccination for 117 LMICs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide vaccination cost to reach herd immunity in a country i.e. cost to vaccinate 70% of the population, cost to vaccinate high-risk population such as population with comorbidity, and cost to vaccinate health professionals. The baseline data, and information on the methodology used for calculating the costs can be found on page 3 and page 4 of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a general user or a policymaker might want to input their own data as they might have more accurate information for certain variables used for cost calculations in this application. Therefore, to accommodate such scenarios, we have provided the option to the users to input their own data for the variables used for vaccination cost calculation, and get the new vaccination cost information based on the user input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this post, i would like to provide more information about this application, and how a user can interact and extract the maximum information from the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page 1: “COVID-19 Vaccination Cost Map”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2021-03-15-covid-19/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
The first page of the application shows the distribution of different vaccination costs– 70% population, high-risk population, and health professionals. These costs are based on our calculation using the baseline data. The baseline data can be found in the “Data Explorer” tab. A user can choose vaccination cost for different population segments, and then can click on a country of their choice to view the total cost to vaccinate its population on the chart in the panel on the right. In addition, there is an option in the panel named “Include COVAX procurement pricing”. If a user does not check this option, the vaccination cost for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/gavi-covax-amc-explained&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COVAX-AMC&lt;/a&gt; eligible countries will use USD5.25 as the median vaccine procurement cost (more information on the median cost can be found in the methodology section of “About this site”). However, if “Include COVAX procurement pricing” is checked then the vaccination cost for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/gavi-covax-amc-explained&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COVAX-AMC&lt;/a&gt; eligible countries will use the COVAX pricing i.e USD3. The countries which are not &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/gavi-covax-amc-explained&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COVAX-AMC&lt;/a&gt; eligible will continue using the median vaccine procurement cost of USD5.25 in the cost calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page 2: “Scenario Analysis and Immunization Comparison”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2021-03-15-covid-19/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
After you have explored the baseline calculation of total costs, but would like to obtain granular information like how much does it cost for a country to procure the vaccine, or how much will it cost to deliver the vaccine to its population, you can move to &lt;code&gt;Scenario Analysis and Immunization Comparison&lt;/code&gt; tab. This tab provides user the ability to visualize costs for various scenarios. For example, a country might only incur vaccine procurement costs, and the delivery cost for such a country was being covered by some international organization or a bilateral donor, or there could be a scenario that vaccine procurement cost might have been take care off for a country by some donor, but the country will still incur delivery cost to vaccinate its population, and finally there could be the usual situation when the country incurs both the vaccine procurement and delivery cost. This page of the application provides option to a user to choose any of these scenarios for the country of their choice and visualize the vaccine procurement, delivery and total cost for 70% population, high-risk, population, and health professions. Similar to the first tab a user can again check “Include COVAX procurement pricing” if they want to include COVAX pricing in the cost calculation for their country of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tab, we also provide user the option to input their data to obtain the vaccination cost for different countries. Users can input their data for the variables on number of health professionals, high-risk population, number of doses, bilateral vaccine procurement cost, and vaccine delivery cost by clicking on &lt;code&gt;Click to input your data!&lt;/code&gt; button. Based on the user input the chart and the table below the chart will update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccination costs, the charts also plots the immunization costs incurred by a country (most recent available data is plotted). A user can make comparison between the incurred immunization cost, and required COVID-19 vaccination cost for any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page 3: “Data Explorer”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2021-03-15-covid-19/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
This page provides the baseline data used for the cost calculation in this application. The baseline data includes information about country’s COVAX eligibility, number of health professionals, immunization cost, total population, high-risk population percent, population covered by COVAX, population covered by bilateral deals, number of doses, vaccine procurement costs (bilateral and COVAX), and vaccine delivery cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page 3: “About this Site”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

The final page of this application provides some background information, github link to the code used in creating this application, and information on selected references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can glimpse the application below. But, the application is best viewed on a full screen. You can access the application on the browser by clicking &lt;a href=&#34;https://centerforpolicyimpact.shinyapps.io/covid-vaccination-costs-analysis/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Part 1- How to create hexbin choropleth map to visualize data?</title>
      <link>/2021/03/07/hexbin/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/2021/03/07/hexbin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewYork Times, The Economist, The Washington Post and many other news outlets often use hexbin maps to convey information in exciting and cool ways. I have been always drawn to these kind of maps, and wanted to create one myself. Last year i got the opportunity (and data!) to learn and create choropleth hexbin maps to show the progression of COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to through the whole process in two parts. In this first part, i will talk about where i got Kenya&amp;rsquo;s shape files, data munging with the shape files data, and creating the hexagonal grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first start with downloading the shape files for Kenya from the GADM website which is a high-resolution database of country administrative areas. The data is not freely available for use in commercial purposes. The website provide files which can be directly read into R, which makes this website a really handy resource. It has pretty latest shape files for almost all the countries in the worlds. You can find Kenya&amp;rsquo;s shape files on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GADM&lt;/a&gt;. We will download level-1 shape files, as we are only interested in county level data. Level-2 and level-3 provide more granulated information of Kenya&amp;rsquo;s administrative areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will unzip the downloaded folder, and load the shape file in R. We will use &amp;ldquo;rgdal&amp;rdquo; library to load the shape file into R. &amp;ldquo;rgdal&amp;rdquo; is R&amp;rsquo;s interface to the &amp;ldquo;Geospatial Abstraction Library (GDAL)&amp;rdquo; which is used by other open source GIS packages such as QGIS and enables R to handle a broader range of spatial data formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(rgdal)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we read the shape file into R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(here) #this package is just used to refer to the folder where the shape file is kept
original_shapes &amp;lt;- readOGR(dsn = here(&amp;quot;./content/post/2021-03-07-hexbin/gadm36_KEN_shp&amp;quot;),  layer = &amp;quot;gadm36_KEN_1&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have read the data into R. we will view the shape file data using the head() function. This function shows the first 5 rows of the shape file data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;head(original_shapes@data)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   GID_0 NAME_0   GID_1          NAME_1 VARNAME_1 NL_NAME_1 TYPE_1 ENGTYPE_1
## 0   KEN  Kenya KEN.1_1         Baringo      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 1   KEN  Kenya KEN.2_1           Bomet      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 2   KEN  Kenya KEN.3_1         Bungoma      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 3   KEN  Kenya KEN.4_1           Busia      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 4   KEN  Kenya KEN.5_1 Elgeyo-Marakwet      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 5   KEN  Kenya KEN.6_1            Embu      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
##   CC_1 HASC_1
## 0   30  KE.BA
## 1   36  KE.BO
## 2   39  KE.BN
## 3   40  KE.BS
## 4   28  KE.EM
## 5   14  KE.EB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the choropleth hex map of kenya we will like to show the names of each county, but we can&amp;rsquo;t write the full name of the counties as this will make the map very busy and chaotic. Therefore, we will abbreviate the names of all the counties, and then show them on the map. To accomplish this, we have created a separate excel file with abbreviations for all county names. You can also google or find these abbreviations on wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will first read this abbreviation excel, and then add these abbreviations to the &amp;ldquo;original_shapes&amp;rdquo; data. Basically, what we are doing here is to gradually add all the information one after other, that we require, to the shape file data to get it ready for the visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;#loading the required library and reading the CSV file with region abbreviation 
library(readxl)
df_abb &amp;lt;- read_excel(here(&amp;quot;./content/post/2021-03-07-hexbin/abb.xlsx&amp;quot;))

#viewing the first 5 rows of the data frame 
head(df_abb)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   County          ABB   ABV  
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;
## 1 Baringo         KE.BA BA   
## 2 Bomet           KE.BO BO   
## 3 Bungoma         KE.BN BN   
## 4 Busia           KE.BS BS   
## 5 Elgeyo-Marakwet KE.EM EM   
## 6 Embu            KE.EB EB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;#removing the ABB column from the data frame 
df_abb &amp;lt;- subset(df_abb ,select = -c(ABB))
head(df_abb)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##   County          ABV  
##   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;
## 1 Baringo         BA   
## 2 Bomet           BO   
## 3 Bungoma         BN   
## 4 Busia           BS   
## 5 Elgeyo-Marakwet EM   
## 6 Embu            EB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we will join the abbreviation data frame with the shape file data frame. The &amp;ldquo;County&amp;rdquo; column of &amp;ldquo;df_abb&amp;rdquo; data frame, and the &amp;ldquo;Name_1&amp;rdquo; column of &amp;ldquo;original_shapes&amp;rdquo; data have the same information i.e. the name of counties in Kenya. Therefore, we will use these columns to join the two data frames. We will use left_join to combine the two data frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;#renaming &amp;quot;County&amp;quot; column using the dplyr library, we could also have joined the two data frames without renaming &amp;quot;County&amp;quot; as well
library(dplyr)
df_abb &amp;lt;- df_abb %&amp;gt;% 
  rename(NAME_1=County)

#using left_join() to join the two data frames
original_shapes@data&amp;lt;- left_join(original_shapes@data, df_abb, by=c(&amp;quot;NAME_1&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;NAME_1&amp;quot;))
head(original_shapes@data)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   GID_0 NAME_0   GID_1          NAME_1 VARNAME_1 NL_NAME_1 TYPE_1 ENGTYPE_1
## 1   KEN  Kenya KEN.1_1         Baringo      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 2   KEN  Kenya KEN.2_1           Bomet      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 3   KEN  Kenya KEN.3_1         Bungoma      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 4   KEN  Kenya KEN.4_1           Busia      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 5   KEN  Kenya KEN.5_1 Elgeyo-Marakwet      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
## 6   KEN  Kenya KEN.6_1            Embu      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;NA&amp;gt; County    County
##   CC_1 HASC_1 ABV
## 1   30  KE.BA  BA
## 2   36  KE.BO  BO
## 3   39  KE.BN  BN
## 4   40  KE.BS  BS
## 5   28  KE.EM  EM
## 6   14  KE.EB  EB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we have joined the two data frames, we will turn our focus tesselating the map polygons of Kenya into hexagons. Tesselation means covering a flat surface (in this case a map) with one or more geometric shapes which do not overlap and there is no gaps between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use &amp;ldquo;geogrid&amp;rdquo; package in R to algorithmically tessellate kenya&amp;rsquo;s map into hexagonal grids. You can find more information on its &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbaileyh/geogrid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will us calculate_grid() function of &amp;ldquo;geogrid&amp;rdquo; library to achieve our goal. This function takes in SpatialPolygonsDataframe or sf object, a learning rate (suggestion = 0.03 to begin), a grid type hexagonal or regular and a seed value. calculate_grid() function uses mathematical algorithm to covert the boundary of the polygons into hexagon shapes, while still trying to preserve the actual shape of the map. Therefore, as we can see there can be many versions of the grids that can be created. The &amp;ldquo;seed&amp;rdquo; attribute of calculate_grid() lets us generate different versions of grids. Thus, we should visually inspect each grid, and choose the grid which best captures the actual shape of the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets first create 6 possible versions of the grid for Kenya&amp;rsquo;s map polygons. You can create more versions and choose from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(geogrid)

par(mfrow = c(2, 3), mar = c(0, 0, 2, 0))
for (i in 1:6) {
  new_cells &amp;lt;- calculate_grid(shape = original_shapes, grid_type = &amp;quot;hexagonal&amp;quot;, seed = i)
  plot(new_cells, main = paste(&amp;quot;Seed&amp;quot;, i, sep = &amp;quot; &amp;quot;))
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
Seed 6, i feel, best preserves Kenya&amp;rsquo;s map geometry. Therefore, we will choose this seed, and assign this grid to convert Kenya&amp;rsquo;s map into hexbin map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;#Grid plot
#we choose grid 6 as it closely matches the actual geometry of kenya
new_cells_reg &amp;lt;- calculate_grid(shape = original_shapes, grid_type = &amp;quot;hexagonal&amp;quot;, seed = 6)

#assign_polygons() function assigns the polygon in the original spatial data to their new location based on the calculated grid function and the seed selected
resultreg &amp;lt;- assign_polygons(original_shapes, new_cells_reg)

#plotting Kenya&#39;s grid map 
plot(resultreg)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will end this post here. In the second part of the tutorial, i will go through the joining of shape file data and the CVOID-19 data for Kenya, and creation of static and animated choropleth hexbin maps to show the progression of COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
