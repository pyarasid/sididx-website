abstract: This report presents the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of a Saving Lives at Birth (SLAB) funded innovation – Pratt Pouch – in Uganda. Pratt Pouch is a novel way to deliver Nevirapine (NVP), an antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis, in a small sachet to HIV-exposed infants (HEI). These packets contain pre-measured NVP solution, which can be administered at home to neonates without direct supervision from a healthcare provider. The CEA presented in this report quantifies the health and social impact of scaling up the use of Pratt Pouch over the period 2019 to 2030 in Uganda. Data on cost of scaling up was collected from Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), while estimate on impact was obtained from a model developed by Grand Challenges Canada (GCC) and reviewed by Duke University.
