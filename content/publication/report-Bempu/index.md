abstract: This report presents the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of a Saving Lives at Birth (SLAB) funded innovation – BEMPU TempWatch – in India. BEMPU TempWatch is a device that continuously monitors a newborn’s temperature, and alerts parents and healthcare providers whenever the baby’s temperature drops below the normal levels – a condition known as hypothermia. The CEA presented in this report quantifies the health and social impact of scaling BEMPU’s TempWatch over the period 2018 to 2030 in fifteen states and fifteen tier one cities in India. Data on costs were collected from BEMPU, while impact estimates were obtained from models developed by Grand Challenges Canada (GCC), and reviewed by Duke University.
